    "We create and consume digital information stored in various file formats on a daily basis such as news presented in\n",
    "HTML files, scientific journal articles in PDF files, tabular data in XLSX spreadsheets and so on. Commercially\n",
    "available scientific instruments generate data in a variety of, typically proprietary, file formats. The proprietary\n",
    "nature of the data impedes scientific research of individual researchers and the collaboration within the scientific\n",
    "community at large. Hence, pycroscopy stores all relevant information including the measurement data, metadata etc.\n",
    "in the most popular file format for scientific data - Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) files.\n",
    "\n",
    "HDF5 is a remarkably straightforward file format to understand since it mimics the familiar folders and files paradigm\n",
    "exposed to users by all operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc. HDF5 files can contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``Datasets`` - similar to spreadsheets and text files with tabular data.\n",
    "* ``Groups`` - similar to folders in a regular file system\n",
    "* ``Attributes`` - small metadata that provide additional information about the Group or Dataset they are attached to.\n",
    "* other advanced features such as hard links, soft links, object and region references, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "h5py is the official software package for reading and writing to HDF5 files in python. Consequently, Pycroscopy relies\n",
    "entirely on h5py for all file related operations. While there are several high-level functions that simplify the\n",
    "reading and writing of Pycroscopy stylized data, it is still crucial that the users of Pycroscopy understand the\n",
    "basics of HDF5 files and are familiar with the basic functions in h5py. There are several tutorials available\n",
    "elsewhere to explain h5py in great detail. This document serves as a quick primer to the basics of interacting with\n",
