    "(HDF5) allows data, whether it is raw measured data or results of analysis, to be stored in multiple datasets within\n",
    "the same file in a tree-like manner. Certain rules and considerations have been made in pyUSID to ensure\n",
    "consistent and easy access to any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The h5py python package provides great functions to create, read, and manage data in HDF5 files. In\n",
    "``pyUSID.hdf_utils``, we have added functions that facilitate scientifically relevant, or pyUSID specific\n",
    "functionality such as easy creation of USID Main datasets, creation of automatically indexed groups to hold\n",
    "results of an analysis, etc. Due to the wide breadth of the functions in ``hdf_utils``, the guide for hdf_utils will be\n",
    "split in two parts - one that focuses on functions that facilitate reading and one that facilitate writing of data.\n",
