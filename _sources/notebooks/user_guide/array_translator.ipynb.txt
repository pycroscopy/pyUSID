    "## Introduction\n",
    "In most scientific disciplines, commercial instruments tend to write the data and metadata out into proprietary file\n",
    "formats that significantly impede access to the data and metadata, thwart sharing of data and correlation of data from\n",
    "multiple instruments, and complicate long-term archival, among other things. One of the data wrangling steps in science\n",
    "is the extraction of the data and metadata out of the proprietary file formats and writing the information into files\n",
    "that are easier to access, share, etc. The overwhelming part of this data wrangling effort is in investigating how to\n",
    "extract the data and metadata into memory. Often, the data and parameters in these files are **not** straightforward to\n",
    "access. In certain cases, additional / dedicated software packages are necessary to access the data while in many other\n",
    "cases, it is possible to extract the necessary information from built-in **numpy** or similar python packages included\n",
    "with **anaconda**. Once the information is accessible in the computer memory, such as in the\n",
    "form of numpy arrays, scientists have a wide variety of tools to write the data out into files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler data such as images or single spectra can easily be written into plain text files. Simple or complex / large /\n",
    "multidimensional data can certainly be stored as numpy data files. However, there are significant drawbacks to writing\n",
    "data into non-standardized structures or file formats. First, while the structure of the data and metadata may be\n",
    "intuitive for the original author of the data, that may not be the case for another researcher. Furthermore, such\n",
    "formatting may change from a day-to-day basis. As a consequence, it becomes challenging to develop code that can accept\n",
    "such data whose format keeps changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution to these challenges is to write the data out into standardized files such as ``h5USID`` files.\n",
    "The USID model aims to make data access, storage, curation, etc. simply by storing the data along with all\n",
    "relevant parameters in a single file (HDF5 for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of copying data from the original format to **h5USID** files is called\n",
    "**Translation** and the classes available in pyUSID and children packages such as pycroscopy that perform these\n",
    "operation are called **Translators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we alluded to earlier, the process of translation can be broken down into two basic components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extracting data and metadata out of the proprietary file format\n",
    "2. Writing the extracted data and metadata into standardized h5USID files\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is the same regardless of the origin, complexity, or size of the scientific data. It is not necessary that\n",
    "the two components be disjoint - there are many situations where both components may need to happen simultaneously\n",
    "especially when the data sizes are very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this document is to demonstrate how one would extract data and parameters from a Scanning Tunnelling\n",
    "Spectroscopy (STS) raw data file obtained from an Omicron Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) into a h5USID file.\n",
    "In this dataset, a spectra was collected for each position in a two-dimensional grid of spatial locations, thereby\n",
    "resulting in a 3D dataset. The data and metadata in this example are small enough that the translation process can\n",
    "indeed be separated out into two distinct components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended pre-requisite reading\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with this example, we recommend reading the previous documents to learn more about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Universal Spectroscopic and Imaging Data (USID) model](https://pycroscopy.github.io/USID/usid_model.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import all necessary packages\n",
    "There are a few setup procedures that need to be followed before any code is written. In this step, we simply load a\n",
    "few python packages that will be necessary in the later steps.\n"
