    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Most of code written for scientific research is in the form of single-use / one-off scripts due to a few common\n",
    "reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the author feels that it is the fastest mode to accomplishing a research task\n",
    "* the author feels that they are unlikely to perform the same operation again\n",
    "* the author does not anticipate the possibility that others may need to run their code\n",
    "\n",
    "However, more often than not, nearly all researchers have found that one or more of these assumptions fail and a lot\n",
    "of time is spent on fixing bugs and generalizing / formalizing code such that it can be shared or reused. Moreover, we\n",
    "live in an era of open science where the scientific community and an ever-increasing number of scientific journals\n",
    "are moving towards a paradigm where the data and code need to be made available with journal papers. Therefore, in the\n",
    "interest of saving time, energy, and reputation, it makes a lot more sense to formalize (parts of) one's data analysis\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many researchers, formalizing data processing or analysis may seem like a daunting task due to the complexity of\n",
    "and the number of sub-operations that need to performed. ``pyUSID.Process`` greatly simplifies the process of\n",
    "formalizing code by lifting or reducing the burden of implementing important, yet tedious tasks and considerations\n",
    "such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **memory management** - reading chunks of datasets that can be processed with the available memory, something very\n",
    "  crucial for very large datasets that cannot entirely fit into the computer's memory\n",
    "* **Scalable parallel computing** -\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On personal computers - considerate CPU usage - Process will use all but one or two CPU cores for the (parallel)\n",
    "    computation, which allows the user to continue using the computer for other activities such as reading mail, etc.\n",
    "  * New in pyUSID v. 0.0.5 - Ability to scale to multiple computers in a cluster. The Process class can scale the same\n",
    "    scientific code written for personal computers to use multiple computers (or nodes) on a high performance\n",
    "    computing (HPC) resource or a cloud-based cluster to dramatically reduce the computational time\n",
    "* **pausing and resuming computation** - interrupting and resuming the computation at a more convenient time,\n",
    "  something that is especially valuable for lengthy computations.\n",
    "* **avoiding repeated computation and returning existing results** - pyUSID.Process will return existing results\n",
    "  computed using the exact same parameters instead of re-computing and storing duplicate copies of the same results.\n",
    "* **testing before computation** - checking the processing / analysis on a single unit (typically a single pixel) of\n",
    "  data before the entire data is processed. This is particularly useful for lengthy computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ``pyUSID.Process``, the user only needs to address the following basic operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reading data from file\n",
    "2. Computation on a single unit of data\n",
    "3. Writing results to disk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of pyUSID.Process\n",
    "The most important functions in the Process class are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``__init__()`` - instantiates a 'Process' object of this class after validating the inputs.\n",
    "* ``_create_results_datasets()`` - creates the HDF5 datasets and Group(s) to store the results.\n",
    "* ``_map_function()`` - the operation that will per be performed on each element in the dataset.\n",
    "* ``test()`` - This simple function lets the user test the ``map_function`` on a unit of data (a single pixel\n",
    "  typically) to see if it returns the desired results. It saves a lot of computational time by allowing the user to\n",
    "  spot-check results before computing on the entire dataset\n",
    "* ``_read_data_chunk()`` - reads the input data from one or more datasets.\n",
    "* ``_write_results_chunk()`` - writes the computed results back to the file\n",
    "* ``_unit_computation()`` - Defines how to process a chunk (multiple units) of data. This allows room for\n",
    "  pre-processing of input data and post-processing of results if necessary. If neither are required, this function\n",
    "  essentially applies the parallel computation on ``_map_function()``.\n",
    "* ``compute()`` - this does the bulk of the work of (iteratively) reading a chunk of data >> processing in parallel\n",
    "  via ``_unit_computation()`` >> calling ``_write_results_chunk()`` to write data. Most sub-classes, including the one\n",
    "  below, do not need to extend / modify this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the \"Flow of Functions\" section near the bottom for a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Several functions of pyUSID.Process such as ``__init__()`` and ``compute()`` were inherited from the\n",
    "  pyUSID.Process class.\n",
    "* In simple cases such as this, we don't even have to implement a function to read the data from the dataset since\n",
    "  pyUSID.Process automatically calculates how much of the data iss safe to load into memory. In this case, the\n",
    "  dataset is far smaller than the computer memory, so the entire dataset can be loaded and processed at once.\n",
    "* In this example, we did not need any pre-processing or post-processing of results but those can be implemented too\n",
    "  if necessary.\n",
    "* The majority of the code in this class would have to be written regardless of whether the intention is formalize the\n",
    "  data processing or not. In fact, we would argue that **more** code may need to be written than what is shown below\n",
    "  if one were **not** formalizing the data processing (data reading, parallel computing, memory management, etc.)\n",

    "As an example of how to integrate with an outside codebase, the package [FFTA](https://github.com/rajgiriUW/ffta/blob/master/ffta/hdf_utils/process.py)\n",
    "implements its own Process class for parallel computation. There you can see how to pass arguments to ``unit_computation()``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Juggling dimensions\n",
    "We intentionally chose a simple example above to quickly illustrate the main components / philosophy of the Process\n",
    "class. The above example had two position dimensions collapsed into the first axis of the dataset and a single\n",
    "spectroscopic dimension (``Frequency``). What if the spectra were acquired as a function of other variables such as a\n",
    "``DC bias``? In other words, the dataset would now have N spectra per location.  In such cases, the dataset would have\n",
    "2 spectroscopic dimensions: ``Frequency`` and ``DC bias``. We cannot therefore simply map the ``map_function()`` to\n",
    "the data in every pixel. This is because the ``map_function()`` expects to work over a single spectra whereas we now\n",
    "have N spectra per pixel. Contrary to what one would assume, we do not need to throw away all the code we wrote above.\n",
    "We only need to add code to juggle / move the dimensions around till the problem looks similar to what we had above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the above problem was written for a dataset of shape ``(P, S)`` where ``P`` is the number of positions\n",
    "and ``S`` is the length of a single spectra. Now, we have data of shape ``(P, N*S)`` where ``N`` is the number of\n",
    "spectra per position. In order to use most of the code already written above, we need to reshape the data to the shape\n",
    "``(P*N, S)``. Now, we can easily map the existing ``map_function()`` on this ``(P*N, S)`` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as implementation is concerned, we would need to add the reshaping step to ``_read_data_chunk()`` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def _read_data_chunk(self):\n",
    "    super(PeakFinder, self)._read_data_chunk()\n",
    "    # The above line causes the base Process class to read X pixels from the dataset into self.data\n",
    "    # All we need to do now is reshape self.data from (X, N*S) to (X*N, S):\n",
    "    # Assuming that we know N (num_spectra) through some metadata:\n",
    "    self.data = self.data.reshape(self.data.shape[0]* num_spectra, -1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that ``_read_data_chunk()`` reads ``X`` pixels at a time where ``X`` is the largest number of pixels whose raw\n",
    "data, intermediate products, and results can simultaneously be held in memory. The dataset used for the example above\n",
    "is tractable enough that the entire data is loaded at once, meaning that ``X = P`` in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, on, the computation would continue as is but as expected, the results would also consequently be of shape\n",
    "``(P*N)``. We would have to reverse the reshape operation to get back the results in the form: ``(P, N)``. So we\n",
    "would prepend the reverse reshape operation to ``_write_results_chunk()``:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def _write_results_chunk(self):\n",
    "    # Recall that the results from the computation are stored in a list called self._results\n",
    "    self._results = np.array(self._results)  # convert from list to numpy array\n",
    "    self._results = self._results.reshape(-1, num_spectra)\n",
    "    # Now self._results is of shape (P, N) and we can store it in the HDF5 dataset as we did above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing on chunks instead of mapping\n",
    "In certain cases, the computation is a little more complex that the ``map_function()`` cannot directly be mapped to\n",
    "the data. Alternatively, in some cases the ``map_function()`` needs to mapped multiple times or different sections of\n",
    "the ``self.data``. For such cases, the ``_unit_computation()`` in ``Process`` provides far more flexibility to the\n",
    "developer. Please see the ``pycroscopy.processing.SignalFilter`` and ``BGlib.gmode.analysis.GIVBayesian`` for examples.\n",
